# Deriving-GPS-Device-Inactivity-Periods
This project examines the about 6000 GPS devices on vendor vehicles to determine those which are deemed inactive because they haven't reported any recorded events in over 48 hours. To achieve this the first and last pings of each day are noted and subtracted to determine periods when no events where recorded.
